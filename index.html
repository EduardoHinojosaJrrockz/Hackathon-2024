          <h1>Why the trees are cool?</h1>
          <p>
              Trees are one of the most iconic natural phenomena on Earth. First appearing during the
              Devonian Period (420 million years ago), trees have and still continue to provide so many
              benefits for multiple species and especially for us humans. Trees slow the buildup of
              greenhouse gasses, increase air quality, provide shade and a home for animals to dwell in, and
              so much more.

          <img src="/images/Deforestation.jpg" alt="Deforestation" class="responsive-img">

          <p>Unfortunately, trees have been destroyed all across the globe to make room for buildings, crops,
              and livestock. Deforestation is one of the leading causes to climate change, contributing to 20%
              of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, multiple species of wild animals are
              losing their homes, soil erodes due to the lopping of trees, and those two factors create an
              overall imbalance in nature.</p>

        <h2>What we can do to help?</h2>

        <p>
          A crucial step into providing care for not only the environment, but also the planet, is to preserve
  the life and stability of trees. Trees act as our natural filters, thus we should do our best to
  protect them at all costs. Replanting trees, recycling, and supporting already existing
  conservation organizations, are just some of the few ways we can support trees and their
  preservation.

        <h2>The benefits of taking care of trees
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are many benefits to taking care of trees, the biggest benefit being the slowing the effects
          of climate change. Other benefits include increased water quality, preventing erosion, saving
          energy, and preventing the pollution of air, water, and noise.

        <h2>A future with trees</h2>
        <p>Many of us have high expectations for the future of the world. Advancements in medicine,
          technology, and infrastructure, are just some of the many things to look forward to. If one were
          to add trees to the list of hopes for the future and took the time to properly preserve and take
          care of them, the world would become even better alongside all the advancements. With an
          increased tree population, once again, the effects of climate change, which is one of the biggest
          dilemmas in the modern era, would be reversed.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, the preservation of trees is very important because of the benefits trees provide
          and problems they solve. Trees act as a natural filter, slow climate change, slow erosion, Trees provide shade and shelter for wildlife, and more. All life could benefit if we were to do our part in preserving the life of trees.
